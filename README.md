# Mac Setup

What you are looking at is my basic Macbook Pro setup using Chef!

## Homebrew. Period.

If you are not using Homebrew for your package management on a Mac, you're doing it wrong.

### What brews do I get?

* Git
* Ack
* Cloc
* Hub
* Macvim
* Memcached
* Node.js
* rbenv
* rbenv-vars
* ruby-build
* Redis
* `tree`
* `the_silver_searcher` (e.g. `ag`)
* tmux
* zsh

## Apps

Some apps that will be installed right away:

* Alfred
* Skype.app
* iTerm2
* BetterSnapTool
* Postgres.app
* Github.app
* Induction.app
* Google Chrome
* VirtualBox

#### Note:

I have not actually been able to test this on a new machine, but it runs perfectly on my current one with no issues.
